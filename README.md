Project game

Game: Avoid Square Homing Bullets.

All you need to do is control the blue square to dodge all red squares, which go horizontally or vertically to your current position from ALL 4 edges of the window.

Press q,a,z,x,c,d,e,w to move in 8 directions (NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, NE, N).

The level does not get harder overtime, but how long can you survive?
