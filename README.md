# My First Game

All libraries are in "My First Game.rar".

Game: Avoid Square Homing Bullets.

All you need to do is control the blue square to dodge all red squares, which go horizontally or vertically to your current position from any edges of the window (depend on the difficulty).

Press q,a,z,x,c,d,e,w to move in 8 directions (NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, NE, N).

Moreover, press a number from 1 to 3 (from slow to fast) to change the player's speed.

The level does not get harder overtime, how long can you survive?
